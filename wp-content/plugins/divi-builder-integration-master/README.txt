Allow the Divi Page Builder to be used on more than just the 'page' and 'project' content types.

== Description ==

By default, the Divi Page Builder only works with 'page' and 'project' content types. This can be an issue, particularly if you plan to have several different content types on your website. This plugin allows you to individually enable or disable the page builder for each content type on your website (except for the 'page and 'project' types, which are always enabled). 

== Dependencies ==
In order for this plugin to work, you MUST have the Divi theme by Elegant Themes installed.
